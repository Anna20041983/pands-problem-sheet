# Pands-Problem-Sheet

**Version 1.0.0**

## Description
These are simple Python programs/codes to provide simple calculations of relevant 7 tasks.
Codes in these problem sheets have to demonstarte understanding of basic coding techniques in Python.

## A list of items in the Pands Problem Sheet:
- Task 2 - Program calculating BMI
- Task 3 - Program creating a string and outputting every second letter in reverse order
- Task 4 - Program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation
- Task 5 - Program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday
- Task 6 - Function to return square root of a number using Newtons Method
- Task 7 - Program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains
- Task 8 - Program that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes

## How to use these
1. Go to each individual task (from 2 to 8)
2. In Task 2 please enter your weight in kg's and height in cm's (eg 65 kg's and 180 cm's). Your BMI will be calulated by the program (eg 20.06)
3. In Task 3 please enter the following sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The program will output every second letter in reverse order
4. In Task 4 please input a positive integer (eg 10) and at each step the program will calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one (eg 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)
5. In Task 5 please run a program to check whether or not today is a weekday
6. In Task 6 please enter a positive number (eg 14.5) to calculate an approximation of its square root (eg. approx 3.8)
7. In Task 7 please enter a letter (eg e) to count the number of letters in Moby Dick text
8. In Task 8 please run a program to to show the plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes

## Inspiration
- Task 2 - The formula for the code is based on information from the relevant website: https://dev.to/mindninjax/how-to-build-a-bmi-calculator-in-python-4g2g
- Task 3 - Understanding on how to write a code is based on information form this website: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/766141/understanding-string-reversal-via-slicing
- Task 4 - The code is based on information from this website: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33508034/making-a-collatz-program-automate-the-boring-stuff
- Task 5 - The code is based on information from this website: https://www.pythonprogramming.in/how-to-find-current-day-is-weekday-or-weekends-in-python.html
- Task 6 - The code is based on information from this website: https://www.goeduhub.com/3398/python-program-to-find-the-square-root-number-newtons-method
- Task 7 - The code is based on information from this website: https://www.sanfoundry.com/python-program-read-file-counts-number/; and Moby Dick text is based on informtaion from these two websites: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701 & http://www.literaturepage.com/read/mobydick-599.html
- Task 8 - The background style is based on information from this website: https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/style_sheets/dark_background.html
